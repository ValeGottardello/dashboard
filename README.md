## Idea ðŸ’¡

The idea was inspired by past work experiences which motivated me to think about what is the best way to organize a team work space, improve efficiency, productivity and a host of other benefits.

## Planning ðŸ“‹

The app was create to users can create accounts as a business or as employees, and create an orderly and clean workspace in which each one, according to their account and their current position, can interact in different ways,
as well as business accounts can:
- create an account
- add dependents
- Update your role or position in the business
- remove employees from your business
- [ideally build the weekly schedule schedule]
On the other hand, the dependents are divided into managers and employees,
employees can:
- determine your time availability
- clock in and clock out, which is deducted from your weekly available hours
- view your assigned tasks
- quit your job and leave the business of which you are a part
- (ideally see the weekly schedule schedule)
and finally the managers can:
- do everything an employee does, plus:
- Assign tasks to the employees of the business of which it is part
- See all assigned tasks, to whom they have been assigned and their status, done or not.
-[ideally build the weekly schedule schedule ]
